    % "Set up" the LED grid. Where is each LED located in x, y plane?    
    % Consider a row-major flattened version of the LED matrix.

    % If we capture regions of higher spatial frequency with our LED arrays,

    % frequency to incorporate the ones in our image. Solve this issue by adjusting 
    % the output image's pixel size (which sets a limit on our highest represented frequency) 
    % to be small enough to accommodate the highest spatial frequency represented by any of the 
    % low res images.

    % To match Nyquist constraints, dynamically compute psize here.

    % With the above psize explanation, we ensure that an arbitrary kx and ky
    % value will scale to an appropriate index in range of (1, length of matrix)
    % corresponding to the center of the NA constraint. Call this scaled index
    % kxc, kyc.

    % But is that really what we want?

    % What if an image's kxc and kyc is somewhere near the edge of the image?
    % Then the circle (NA constraint) in the Fourier space might go out of bounds!
    % So, modify computations to scale kx, ky to be closer to the center so that
    % the NA constraint lies within the boundaries of the matrix. The
    % implication here is that kxc, kyc should fall within NA from the left, and NA
    % from the right of the image. Hence the subtraction of 2*NA (and an
    % additional 1, just in case) from the original range of values within which
    % kxc and kyc could fall.
